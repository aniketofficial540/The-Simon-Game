🌟 Project Highlight: The Simon Game! 🎮

I'm excited to share my latest project - the Simon Game! Inspired by the classic memory game, this project challenges players to remember and replicate sequences of colors. Each correct guess increases the difficulty level, making it a fun and engaging way to test your memory skills.

🔧 Tech Stack:

HTML5 for the structure </br>
CSS for styling </br>
JavaScript & JQuery for functionality </br>

🖥️ How It Works:

A random color sequence is generated. </br>
Players must guess the colors in the correct order. </br>
Each successful round increases the level and sequence length. </br>
